# tree-project
Personal project

Stage 1 
- Create a calculator that can determine the amount of carbon sequestered from the atmosphere dependant on what species of tree, where it is in NZ and at what planting distance (the amount of square meterage the tree planting takes up), also graph the amount of carbon over time and the carbon credits you will recieve

- Show the reverse e.g. be able to say I want this much carbon sequestered with this species of tree in this location of NZ, how much do I need to plant.

Stage 2
- Move it to an app where volunteers for planting days can track the numbers of trees they have planted to show their carbon offset contribution.

Stage 3 
- Invite landowners to provide a piece of their land to plant on to people that don't have acccess to land.
